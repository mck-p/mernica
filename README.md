# Mernica

> Like Monica but different

## Overview

Mernica wants to help you become a better You. No strings attached.

## System Architecture

This is some far-out, convoluted stuff my friend. The `src/modules/system.js`
file is kinda like a holder of things. It connects _stuff_ to _things_.

`src/modules/events.js` is our Core application that takes in events from _somewhere_
and sends events _to something_. So far, that is the _adapaters_, specifically
the `src/modules/adapters/http.js` adapter that exposes an HTTP port.

### Features

_**Self Tracker**_

> **Implemented**: _TBD_

You can't grow until you are able to track your progress. Mernica offers you
ways to track both Emotions and Moods in order to allow you to see how these
change over time and as response to life events.
